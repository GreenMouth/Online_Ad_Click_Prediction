Predict if website user will click on an online advertisement or not to build targeted marketing strategy

#Note:
In practical environment, clicks training data will be highly unbalanced.

#Normalization vs Standardization:

Normalize means in mathematics divide a vector by its magnitude to produce a unit vector.  
Standardization means to transform it to have zero mean (subtraction of mean). 
Normalization scales in data in short interval like [0,1] and data in standardization are unbounded.
